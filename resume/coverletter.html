          RE: Hardware/Software Tester </br></br>

          Dear Mr. Rudolph, </br></br>

          The energy industry is a very important and innovative field now more than ever. I am interested in the testing position because of the opportunity to work on impactful technologies within the energy sector.
          Reliable clean power is one of the most important problems of the century and I would love to be involved in solving it. I believe that with my previous experience I would be a great fit for PlanB </br>E-Storage and this position. </br></br>

          In my previous co-op position, I was responsible for both automated and manual testing of web pages and mobile applications. This helped improve both my interpersonal skills, through communication with developers, and technical skills, through writing and executing test cases. I was also given the lead QA role on a number of projects, which required me to take initiative in completing tasks and providing a line of communication between clients and developers. </br></br>

          Additionally, through my education at Simon Fraser University I have had the opportunity to work with various electrical equipment including oscilloscopes, DMMS, and soldering stations. I have also worked with various software useful in electronic design and testing such as LTSpice and MATLAB. </br></br>

          As an aspiring engineer, I would be very excited to work with a company like PlanB E-Storage. I believe this opportunity would be very beneficial to us in the future. If you would like to further discuss my skills and qualifications please contact me through the co-op office. Thank you for your time and consideration. </br></br>

          Sincerely, </br></br></br></br></br></br>

          Justin Crosby
