        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Hey! I'm Justin and I'm currently a third year computer engineering student at Simon Fraser University. I enjoy working with both software and hardware, but thus far my focus has been on software. When I'm not writing code or playing with gadgets you'll probably find me playing piano or listening to music. I've been a pianist for over 10 years and, while I do have some classical training, my repertoire mainly contains rock, blues, and video game themes. Oh yeah, did I mention I'm a gamer? I grew up with Zelda and Mario on the N64, but more recently I've been playing titles such as The Last Of Us and Bioshock Infinite. It's really amazing to see how far technology and software have come and, once I finish off my degree, I hope to contribute to the progression of the industry.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Growing up in a small town meant a lot of my learning was, and still is, self-directed. Projects are a great way to hone and practice your skills. It started with small programs and games in highschool and moved onto much more complicated projects combining my knowledge of both software and hardware. Below are a couple projects that I am particularly proud of and make use of every day.

              <h3>Arduino Door Lock</h3>
              <div>
                Using an <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, an <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Mini-125Khz-RFID-Module-External-LEDBuzzer-Port-70mm-Reading-Distance-p-1724.html">RFID sensor</a>, and a <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Servo-p-1241.html">servo</a> I was able to implement a door lock that can be toggled from outside using a key card. The code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/justincrosby/arduino-rfid-lock">GitHub</a>.

                With <a href="http://www.eventghost.org/">EventGhost</a> and <a href="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/">Tasker</a> I am able to automate my stereo and the power cycle of my computer.

          Thus far I only have professional experience in quality assurance and, while that has been way to gain experience in the tech industry, I hope to move into a software development role in the future.
