        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I'm a fifth year computer engineering student at Simon Fraser University with an interest in both hardware and software. My latest co-op at Intel had me working on firmware for embedded systems, which I found both interesting and rewarding especially since it required in depth knowledge of both the hardware and software used in the product. When I'm not doing my computer nerd stuff I enjoy being a pianist and hobby aquarist as well as hiking, biking, and skating.

          <p>
            Growing up in a small town meant a lot of my learning was, and still is, self-directed. Projects are a great way to hone and practice your skills. It started with small programs and games in highschool and moved onto much more complicated projects combining my knowledge of both software and hardware. Below are a few projects that I am particularly proud of.

                For my capstone project I worked in a team of engineers to create a local guidance system based on ultrasonic distance calculation. The project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/justincrosby/localsonic">Github.</a>

            <div class="description">
              At Intel I was on the performance team; a tight-knit group that is responsible for tracking performance results and identifying potential problems as the product is developed. Once performance degradations were identified our team worked to debug and provide fixes for these issues. This is my first experience working with hardware and taking on a more development focused role and I enjoyed both these aspects.

              At Appnovation I was responsible for testing various web pages and applications. I had the opportunity to lead the team on a number of projects and work with clients and other teams within the company. I also became the go to person for Behat scripting; an automated testing system that allowed our clients to migrate their sites to different environments with minimal manual testing.
